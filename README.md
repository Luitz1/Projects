# Personal Projects
## Overview
This repository contains personal projects that I am gradually uploading. Through each project, I not only showcase my work but also document my learning process as I explore and master different topics, techniques, and tools. It serves as a growing portfolio reflecting both my current skills and my ongoing development across areas like data analysis, automation, and electronics programming.
## Repository Sections
<details>
<summary><b>Data Analyst Projects</b></summary>
This section contains projects focused on data manipulation, analysis, and modeling. You'll find Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating, Data cleaning and preprocessing, Exploratory data analysis, Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, Data visualization an others projects of Data.

<a href="https://github.com/Luitz1/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Analyst%20Projects/1_example_weather">Example Weather</a>
The Notebook "1_example_weather" has a simple exploratory analysis, it is about visualizing what type of information the dataset has, how some variables behave, what magnitudes and units are handled and very superficial things.

<a href="https://github.com/Luitz1/Projects/tree/main/Data%20Analyst%20Projects/2_exple_houses">Example Houses</a>
The Notebook "2_exple_houses" has a simple exploratory analysis, it is about visualizing what type of information the dataset has, how some variables behave, what magnitudes and units are handled and very superficial things, and at the end a linear regression model is trained to make some predictions.

<a href="https://github.com/Luitz1/Projects/tree/main/util_projects/img_to_pdf">Image to PDF</a>
The python script "img_to_pdf" helps to convert one or more images arranged in a specific folder called IN and make a PDF file and leave it in the OUT folder.

<a href="https://github.com/Luitz1/Projects/tree/main/util_projects/unlockPDF">Unlock PDF Documents</a>
This Python script "unlockPDF" allows you to unlock a PDF file with a password, that is, having the file and its password, a new unlocked PDF file is generated.

<a href="https://github.com/Luitz1/Projects/tree/main/Electronic_Projects/KeyBoard_with_Leonardo">Keyboard with Arduino Leonardo</a>
This project aims to make a "keyboard" with Arduino Leonardo, this has the function of acting as a Rubber Duck. It contains two relatively simple codes, the first in extension (. ino) for Arduino IDE and the second in (. C) to use with PlatformIO or another compiler.
